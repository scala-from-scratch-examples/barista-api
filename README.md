# barista-api

This is the barista API skeleton project from the book "Scala from Scratch: Understanding". Readers are expected to clone this repository and fill in the gaps
in the implementation.

## Running the application

Use `sbt run` - this will start a web server listening on port `8080`. You will be able to explore the API by making a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8080`.
